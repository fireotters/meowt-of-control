# GMTK Gamejam 2020's project repo

This is a blank 2D template project for GMTK's Gamejam 2020.

Two Scenes: Main Menu with options menu, Game Scene with pause menu

### Basic features
- Audio management. Music tracks can be swapped, volumes for Music/SFX can be changed and saved
- Pause menu. Pauses time in-game and all game sounds

### Extra scripts
- Discord RP Manager: Requires set up
- ButtonHighlightFix: Stops two buttons being highlighted at once
- FindMissingReferences: Kept in Assets/Editor. Click 'Tools/Find Missing(...)' in Unity menu bar to find all missing references in a scene

### Placeholders
- Two music tracks, one UI sound effect
- Icons for the music/SFX slider handles

### Other notes
- All text objects are TextMeshPro. Keep this up from the get go, and it won't be annoying to fix later
- All [script](../src/master/Script Attributions.md) and [sound](../src/master/Sound Attributions.md) usages are to be recorded in the Detailed Attributions text files
- Please when adding new information to .md files, format the document properly. [Here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) you can find a simple
 Markdown cheatsheet to keep the document clean.
