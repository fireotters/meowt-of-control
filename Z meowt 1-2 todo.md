Done
- Overheating too forgiving
    - All towers now have mid recovery rate, higher penalties
- Towers given more utility
    - Pillows: Faster shooting, targets one enemy until they die
    - Water: Slightly faster, targets enemies that are not yet wet (if possible)
    - Fridge: Much higher range, higher penalty, targets enemies that are not yet iced (only if possible, else ignore all enemies in range)
- Big enemies scarier
    - All towers no longer prioritise Big Chungus. It's up to the player to finish off smaller enemies to avoid distracting the towers
    - Big Chungus are also bigger & more health
    - AoE effects them less
- Normal enemies touching scrap for long enough destroys it
