- Main menu button colour
- Limit on towers. Very low water towers, water towers should be 50
- Overheating too forgiving
- Show prompts on first round
- Super easy first round
- Pillow turrets shoot slower, super easy to overheat
- Too much yarn early on, have yarn be an optional objective
- Water tower stun too long
- Big enemies more health, much less effect from slowing towers
- Shoot attempt sound when reloading
- Add letterboxing and custom window sizes

Done
